"""
Signed API requests: how a client signs one, and the rules the server checks
it by. Standard library only, so a client written in Python (clinic-triage,
taggle-rock) can copy this file as it is.

A signature proves three things without the secret ever crossing the wire:
the sender holds the client's secret, nothing in the request was changed on
the way (method, path, query, body), and the request is fresh (a timestamp and
a one-time nonce, or for a device with no clock, a counter that only goes up).

The wire format, with a worked example, is in notes/auth-hardening.md. Ports
to other languages should reproduce the known-answer vectors in
tests/test_api_auth.py before talking to a real server.
